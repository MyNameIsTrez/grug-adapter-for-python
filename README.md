# grug-adapter-for-python

This repository contains `generate.py`, which reads `mod_api.json`, and outputs `adapter.c` based on it. The game developer can then manually compile this to `adapter.so`.

See [grug terminal game: Python](https://github.com/MyNameIsTrez/grug-terminal-game-python) for example usage.
